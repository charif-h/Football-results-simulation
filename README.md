# Football-results-simulation
This project simulates the results of football leagues and cup. This version simulate the european Champions league. 

For the moment, I decided to make the whole project in one Html file that contains all CSS and JS codes, which make the file too much long and complicated (may be I change my mind later). I just wanted to be easy to execute.
